- name: Drishti
  i18n: 
  gh_user: DedSec-1
  repo: Drishti
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/drishti.png
  desc: Drishti is basically a gesture to speech convertor DL model implemented in python and deployed using flask.
        It recognizes the hand gestures of the subject (in our case a person) and predicts the corresponding alphabet. 
        We have also made the use of text to speech convertor to provide a voice enabled output.
